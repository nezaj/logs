### Dump
* Might be worth investing more time in tooling weekly review process
* Worth asking yourself how to be more actionable about metrics you are tracking

### Improvements
* Start tracking how you felt your overall day went
* Calculate weekly average

### Questions
Things worth digging into and analyzing:
* Is there a correlation between calories and protein? I wonder if weeks with higher average protein consumption results in lower calories
* What days do I usually consume the most calories
* What's the rough breakdown of my calories over time
* Is there a relationship between exercise and calories consumed
