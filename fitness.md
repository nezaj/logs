Notes:

**Diet**
* Again, ate more calories this week than the previous one
* The real culrpit this week was the box of protein bars I ordered
* They were delicious, and I had zero control, ate 12 bars over two days
* 12 bars -> Extra 2620, if I had eaten 3 instead would have cut ~2000/285cal avg
* --> Don't buy protein bars in bulk, they're like candy/ice-cream and too tempting
* Was able to stay clean for most of the week, but went over on Thursday
* I noticed once I go a little bit over, I'm more willing to go over a lot
* --> Keep calories <1850 every day, weekends included

**Exercise**
* Worked out everyday this week! No need for rest days :)
* Solid Jiu-jitsu sessions
* Solid lift sessions
* Solid pull-ups/abs sessions, resetting was a good idea
* For next week switch up abs to do weighted leg lifts
* Look into VOx2 training for runs

**Personal**
* Was not productive with code during the week
* Spent too much reading about tech that doesn't solve my current problems
* This had a negative effect on mood for sure
* --> Shipping code makes me feel better, strive to commit each weekday

* Didn't get as much done as I wanted, but great learning experience

**Takeaway**
* Don't buy protein bars in bulk, they're like candy/ice-cream and too tempting
